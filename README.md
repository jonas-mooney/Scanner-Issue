**Temporary repo to share while solving the app crash**<br>

**git clone https://github.com/jonas-mooney/Scanner-Issue.git**<br>
**npm install**<br>
**Uncomment line 33 of the Scanner.tsx component.**<br>
**npx expo start**<br>
**When the Expo Go app is running on your phone, you'll need to scan a barcode.**<br>
**After barcode scan, the modal will popup. When dismissed, the app should crash.**<br>

**I really appreciate you're help taking a look at this! Thank you!**<br>
